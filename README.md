Chrome dinosaur bot (WIP)
=========================

This is a simple bot to play the Google Chrome offline dinosaur game. Currently only supporting Linux with GTK3.

This project is heavily in development. All changes are pushed to the `development` branch until release.

To compile and run this project, you need to install `pkg-config` for the makefile and the `GTK3 development libraries`.
For Ubuntu, this is (supposed) 

`sudo apt-get install pkg-config libgtk-3-dev`
